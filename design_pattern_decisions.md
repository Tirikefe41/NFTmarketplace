## Role Base Access Control

I used RBAC from openzeppelin to create two roles admin and validator.<br>

admin has the ability to remove or add a new validator

## Circuit Breakers

the admin can pause the contract in case of detecting hacking activity

## Inheritance and Interfaces

I inherited ERC721 from oppenzepplin contracts
